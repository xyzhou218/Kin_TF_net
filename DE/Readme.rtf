Differential Expression (DE) Analysis

To perform DE analysis, users should prepare the required raw count matrices as described in the ../Data directory.

The script:
	•	0_kinases_Prodromal_LRRK2_vs_HealthyControl_kinases_DE_analysis.Rmd runs the DE workflow and identifies kinases with altered expression in the Prodromal_LRRK2 vs Healthy Control comparison.

To run the analysis for other subgroups, modify the input file names and subgroup labels accordingly.
Note on Fold-Change Thresholds: Each subgroup uses a slightly different FCcutoff value. Users can find the exact cutoffs in Supplementary Table S2 of the manuscript.

Subgroups Included in the Manuscript
	•	Prodromal_LRRK2
	•	Sporadic_PD
	•	PD_LRRK2
	•	PD_GBA
	•	Prodromal_GBA
	•	Prodromal_Hyposmia
	•	Prodromal_RBD
	•	SWEDD

After run, the results will be saved in “./1_results”.
